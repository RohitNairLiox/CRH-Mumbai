	<p class="borderelement1 largefont">
<strong>CRH</strong> believes that housing is a basic human right, which is very closely related to right to life guaranteed by the Indian Constitution under Article 21. It believes that processes of development that result in involuntary displacement of people should be questioned and resisted. In urban areas where displacement is rampant it becomes very necessary to assert the rights of the poor. CRH through its multiprong strategies works at the grassroots level in association with CBOs, NGOs and with the communities aiming at political and human right education while searching for an alternative for establishing a right to the city, a right to participate and a right to govern. CRH also comprises of a network of organizations supporting them in making solid understanding about housing rights, educating them through training programme and helping them at the time of crisis.

<li>The main objective of CRH is to make a city inclusive for all its residents. Work towards making a city where all its residents have opportunities for livelihood, basic amenities, housing and security and participation in governance.</li><br>
